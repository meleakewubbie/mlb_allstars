# MLB All-Star Player Characteristics Project
* MLB_Results.pdf shows a complete report of my questions, processes, and results.
* Processed a dataset from kaggle.com that helped me answer three questions I made from scratch.
* Used Git and Python to perform various analyses on MLB All-Star players.
* Computed average yearly statistics from 1995-2015 for MLB All-Star players based on position using pandas.
* Trained a model to predict All-Star status based on stats for any player using decision tree regression via scikit-learn.
* Computed what states produced the most All-Star players from different yearly timeframes and plotted the results on bar charts using matplotlib.
